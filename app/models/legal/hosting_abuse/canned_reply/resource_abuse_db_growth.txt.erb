WARNING: Database Abuse on Account '<%= reseller_username %>' - <%= @abuse.server.name %>
<% end -%>

Hello,

It has come to our attention that your account's activity affects our overall server performance and other accounts hosted thereon. The reason for it appears to be the rapid growth of the following database assigned to your website:

<%= @abuse.resource.db_name %>
<% if @abuse.resource.db_size %><%= "#{@abuse.resource.db_size} GB" %><% end %>

Please be informed that we have moved the subject database to the home folder of your hosting account and suspended the account in question in order to decrease its impact on other accounts located on the server. In order to have the account unsuspended it is required to confirm that you will start working on the optimisation of the subject database immediately after the unsuspension.

Here are the options generally suggested in order to resolve such issues:
- contact a webmaster for them to review the subject database and assist you with resolving the issue;
- in case you are a webmaster or an advanced user yourself, you can download the subject database to a local machine, install phpMyAdmin, which is an open source tool written in PHP intended to handle the administration of MySQL and optimize the database following the next article: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9791;
- get in contact with our technical team in order for them to review the subject database and advise a solution or fix the matter, if possible.*

*Please keep in mind that the investigation of our technical team may not result in a solution. We do not provide web development services and other services related to code debugging as at the moment we prefer to stay a hosting-oriented Namecheap division only.

Additionally, you might consider upgrading your current hosting plan to a <%= @abuse.resource.upgrade.name %>. This can be performed by ordering the corresponding package from us. As all upgrades are prorated, any balance from your existing plan will be carried over to your Namecheap funds that may be used to settle the next generated invoice or pay for any other services with us.

Please let us know if you have any further questions or require any assistance.
