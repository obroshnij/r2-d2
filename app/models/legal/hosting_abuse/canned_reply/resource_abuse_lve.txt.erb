IMPORTANT: Account '<%= reseller_username %>' is suspended due to Resource Abuse - <%= @abuse.server.name %>

WARNING: Resource Abuse on Account '<%= reseller_username %>' - <%= @abuse.server.name %>
<% end -%>

Hello,

It has come to our attention that the '<%= reseller_username %>' hosting account is overusing limits of shared resources, affecting the server performance and other accounts hosted thereon. We would like to mention that all the limits set for shared hosting accounts are burstable in order to let every account handle load spikes, however, those spikes must not be persistent not to cause the impact on all accounts of the shared server. In order to obtain additional information about the limits please refer to Paragraph 10. "Additional Acceptable Use Policy for Virtual accounts" of our AUP at http://www.namecheap.com/legal/hosting/aup.aspx

<% if @abuse.resource.abuse_type_ids == [5] -%>
The server is abused by MySQL queries.
<% elsif !@abuse.resource.abuse_type_ids.include?(5) -%>
The following resource limits are being exceeded:

<%= @abuse.resource.abuse_types.map(&:name).map { |r| "- #{r}" }.join("\n") %>
<% else -%>
The server is abused by MySQL queries and the following resource limits are being exceeded:

<%= (@abuse.resource.abuse_types.map(&:name) - ['MySQL Queries']).map { |r| "- #{r}" }.join("\n") %>
<% end -%>
<% if resource_sites.count > 0 -%>

According to the investigation performed by the representatives of our technical team, the following <%= 'website'.pluralize(resource_sites.count) %> <%= resource_sites.count == 1 ? 'is' : 'are' %> consuming too much resources which results in a poor server performance: <%= resource_sites.join(", ") %>.
<% end -%>

Unoptimized scripts / incorrectly configured cron jobs / a lot of simultaneous visitors / etc. are probable causes of the resource overuse. Here are the diagnostic steps generally suggested for finding the corresponding solution:

<% if resource_sites.length == 0 -%>
- enable caching plugins (Note: Such plugins in conjunction with other website elements might malfunction. That is why in case one of the plugins is already in use it is required to disable the plugin temporarily and monitor the account’s activity.)
<% if @abuse.resource.abuse_type_ids.include?(5) -%>
- revise all active plugins disabling unnecessary ones (in some cases even changing the current theme might be of use)
- make sure that all websites are well optimized and working as expected (if you are not a developer or professional in website administration, we strongly recommend reaching out to webmaster services)
- if the SSH access is enabled for the account it is possible to check which threads are being processed by the MySQL server:
  Step 1 - Connect to your database using the following command:  mysql -uusername -ppassword database_name
  Step 2 - Once connected, please use the following command to see the active threads:  show full processlist
<% end -%>
<% if @abuse.resource.abuse_type_ids.include?(3) -%>
- please refer to the Awstats option in cPanel (in case at least one of your websites is receiving a considerably high amount of hits/incoming traffic volume, an upgrade is the most valid solution). Addiitonally, you may notice some excessive traffic coming from certain IP addresses which may be blocked if you follow this manual: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9536/29/how-to-block-ips-from-accessing-your-website
- if the SSH access is enabled for the account, the “ top -c ” command is of use in order to find the webpages causing the most significant impact (in case an active process takes much time or a critical amount of virtual memory for being completed, it should be disabled)
<% end -%>
<% if @abuse.resource.abuse_type_ids.include?(4) -%>
- please consider applying DDoS protection services. Currently Namecheap does not provide this type of services, therefore it is advised to find a third-party vendor
- it is advised to double-check all active scripts as some of them might be unoptimized
<% end -%>
<% else -%>
- scan your website using the Google PageSpeed Insight at https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/
- consider the results of the scan and make steps to optimize your website. If you are a WordPress user, the following article may come in handy: https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/article.aspx/9399/2182/how-to-speed-up-and-optimize-wordpress-website . For other CMSs you may consider going through similar steps and enabling caching plugins (Note: Such plugins in conjunction with other website elements might trigger malfunction. That is why in case one of the plugins is already in use it is required to disable the plugin temporary and monitor the account’s activity.)

The following Namecheap KnowledgeBase category contains articles about resource limits, LVE (Lightweight Virtual Environment) statistics and measures applicable for resource overuse issues https://www.namecheap.com/support/knowledgebase/subcategory.aspx/103/lve-cloudlinux

Additionally, you might consider upgrading your current hosting plan to <%= @abuse.resource.upgrade.name %>. If you decide to proceed with this route, please let us know. Once your confirmation is received, this ticket will be forwarded to our Billing Department for further assistance.

<% if suspended? -%>
Unfortunately, we have been forced to suspend the reported account in order to prevent the resource abuse and its impact on other accounts located on the server. In order to have the account unsuspended it is required to confirm that all measures necessary for the issue resolving will be taken immediately after the unsuspension.
<% else -%>
It is required to look into the issue decreasing the resource usage and providing us with the corresponding results within the next <%= @abuse.suggestion.name.match(/\d+/).to_s %> hours. Otherwise, if the resource overuse persists after the time-frame provided and/or no response is received from your side we might be forced to suspend the account in question. We would like to emphasize that in case the impact on the server increases within the specified time-frame there might be no other option but to suspend the account immediately, to our regret.

Looking forward to your reply.
